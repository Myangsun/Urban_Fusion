"""
Design for the Urban Fusion Agent Framework for Site Selection

This file outlines the architecture for a LangChain-based agent system that can answer
site selection benchmark questions using GPT-4 and evaluate against ground truth answers.
"""

# Framework Overview
"""
The agent framework follows the architecture provided in the diagram:

1. Coordinator: Central orchestrator that manages the workflow
2. Specialized Agents:
   - GeoAgent: Handles geospatial constraints and calculations
   - Constraints Agent: Processes and evaluates different constraint types
   - Explanation Agent: Provides reasoning and explanations for decisions
3. Functional Tools:
   - MapTool: Visualizes and processes geospatial data
   - Data AnalysisTool: Analyzes the CSV data for constraint evaluation
   - Visualization Tool: Creates visualizations of results

Evaluation Metrics:
- Accuracy: Exact match between predicted and ground truth parcel IDs
- Precision: Proportion of predicted parcels that are correct
- Recall: Proportion of ground truth parcels that are predicted
- F1 Score: Harmonic mean of precision and recall
- Constraint Satisfaction: Assessment of how well individual constraints are satisfied
"""

# Required Libraries
"""
- langchain: For building the agent framework
- openai: For GPT-4 integration
- geopandas: For geospatial data processing
- pandas: For data analysis
- shapely: For geometric operations
- matplotlib: For visualization
- numpy: For numerical operations
"""

# Coordinator Design
"""
The Coordinator is responsible for:
1. Parsing the benchmark question
2. Breaking down constraints into categories (Geospatial, Temporal, Economic, Market)
3. Delegating tasks to specialized agents
4. Aggregating results
5. Producing the final answer
"""

# Specialized Agents Design

## GeoAgent
"""
The GeoAgent is responsible for:
1. Processing geospatial constraints (e.g., radius buffers, proximity requirements)
2. Performing spatial operations on parcel data
3. Identifying parcels that meet geospatial criteria
4. Returning filtered parcels to the Coordinator
"""

## Constraints Agent
"""
The Constraints Agent is responsible for:
1. Processing non-geospatial constraints (Temporal, Economic, Market)
2. Analyzing the CSV data to evaluate constraints
3. Filtering parcels based on constraint satisfaction
4. Returning filtered parcels to the Coordinator
"""

## Explanation Agent
"""
The Explanation Agent is responsible for:
1. Generating explanations for why certain parcels were selected or rejected
2. Providing reasoning for constraint satisfaction
3. Creating a narrative of the decision-making process
4. Enhancing transparency of the agent's operations
"""

# Functional Tools Design

## MapTool
"""
The MapTool is responsible for:
1. Loading and processing geospatial data (GeoJSON)
2. Creating buffer zones around points
3. Performing spatial joins and operations
4. Visualizing parcels and constraints on maps
"""

## Data AnalysisTool
"""
The Data AnalysisTool is responsible for:
1. Loading and processing CSV data
2. Filtering data based on constraints
3. Aggregating data for analysis
4. Computing metrics for constraint evaluation
"""

## Visualization Tool
"""
The Visualization Tool is responsible for:
1. Creating visualizations of results
2. Generating maps of selected parcels
3. Plotting constraint satisfaction metrics
4. Enhancing interpretability of results
"""

# Workflow
"""
1. User submits a benchmark question
2. Coordinator parses the question and identifies constraints
3. Coordinator delegates geospatial constraints to GeoAgent
4. GeoAgent uses MapTool to process geospatial data and returns filtered parcels
5. Coordinator delegates non-geospatial constraints to Constraints Agent
6. Constraints Agent uses Data AnalysisTool to evaluate constraints and returns filtered parcels
7. Coordinator intersects results from all agents to get final set of parcels
8. Explanation Agent generates reasoning for the selection
9. Visualization Tool creates maps and visualizations of results
10. System evaluates results against ground truth using defined metrics
"""

# Implementation Plan
"""
1. Set up LangChain environment and GPT-4 integration
2. Implement functional tools (MapTool, Data AnalysisTool, Visualization Tool)
3. Implement specialized agents (GeoAgent, Constraints Agent, Explanation Agent)
4. Implement Coordinator to orchestrate the workflow
5. Implement evaluation system to compare results with ground truth
6. Test the system on benchmark questions
7. Optimize performance based on results
"""

# Evaluation System
"""
The evaluation system will:
1. Compare predicted parcels with ground truth parcels
2. Calculate Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score
3. Assess constraint satisfaction for each constraint type
4. Generate a comprehensive evaluation report
