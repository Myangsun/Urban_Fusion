# Constraint-Based Site Selection Approach

## Overview
This document outlines the constraint-based site selection approach for the UrbanFusion system, focusing on identifying locations that meet specific constraints rather than optimizing for "best" locations.

## Constraint Categories

### 1. Geospatial Constraints
- **Proximity**: Distance-based constraints (e.g., within 3km of city center)
- **Zoning**: Land use requirements (e.g., commercial zones only)
- **Adjacency**: Proximity to specific features (e.g., green zones, arterial roads)
- **Visibility**: Physical visibility requirements (e.g., minimum street frontage)

### 2. Temporal Constraints
- **Peak Hours**: Time-specific requirements (e.g., lunch rush, dinner peak)
- **Seasonality**: Seasonal variations (e.g., summer demand, Ramadan hours)

### 3. Economic Constraints
- **Cost**: Financial limitations (e.g., maximum rent, delivery cost ratio)
- **Revenue**: Income requirements (e.g., minimum daily GMV)
- **ROI**: Return on investment thresholds (e.g., minimum annual ROI)

### 4. Market Constraints
- **Competition**: Competitive landscape requirements (e.g., maximum number of similar cuisines)
- **Demand**: Customer demand thresholds (e.g., minimum orders per day)

### 5. Demographic Constraints
- **Population Density**: Residential density requirements (e.g., minimum residents/km²)
- **Age Group**: Target demographic requirements (e.g., 20-35 year old majority)
- **Income Level**: Economic status requirements (e.g., minimum monthly income)
- **Cultural**: Cultural considerations (e.g., expat-friendly zones)

### 6. Operational Constraints
- **Logistics**: Physical requirements (e.g., minimum kitchen size)
- **Access**: Transportation requirements (e.g., 24/7 delivery access)
- **Compliance**: Regulatory requirements (e.g., halal certification)

## Implementation Approach

### 1. Constraint Extraction
- Parse user queries to identify explicit constraints
- Categorize constraints by type (geospatial, economic, etc.)
- Convert natural language constraints to structured parameters

### 2. Constraint Representation
- Represent constraints as key-value pairs
- Use consistent naming conventions (e.g., `min_` prefix for minimum thresholds)
- Support different constraint types (numeric, boolean, string)

### 3. Constraint Application
- Apply constraints sequentially or in parallel
- Filter locations based on constraint satisfaction
- Track which constraints are satisfied for each location

### 4. Constraint Satisfaction Verification
- Verify that all constraints are satisfied for recommended locations
- Calculate constraint satisfaction metrics (e.g., percentage of constraints met)
- Provide explanations for why locations meet or fail constraints

## Query Processing Flow

### 1. Query Analysis
- Coordinator agent analyzes the query to identify constraints
- Constraints are categorized and structured
- Query is reformulated if needed for clarity

### 2. Location Identification
- GeoAgent identifies potential locations based on geospatial constraints
- Uses spatial operations (buffer, intersection, distance calculation)
- Generates code to perform specific spatial analyses

### 3. Constraint Filtering
- Constraints Agent applies all identified constraints
- Filters locations to only those that satisfy all constraints
- Ranks locations by constraint satisfaction if multiple locations qualify

### 4. Result Validation
- Evaluation Agent validates that results meet all constraints
- Calculates metrics on constraint satisfaction
- Ensures results are complete and accurate

### 5. Explanation Generation
- Explanation Agent generates detailed explanations
- Clarifies which constraints each location satisfies
- Provides transparency into the decision-making process

## Example Constraint-Based Queries

### Example 1: Restaurant Location with Multiple Constraints
```
Find restaurant locations in Dubai with a delivery radius of 3km of Dubai's city center, 
in residential areas, with less than 2 Italian cuisines in a 5km radius.
```

**Extracted Constraints:**
- Geospatial/Proximity: Within 3km of Dubai's city center
- Geospatial/Zoning: In residential areas
- Market/Competition: Less than 2 Italian cuisines in a 5km radius

### Example 2: Commercial Property with Specific Requirements
```
Find commercial properties in Business Bay with at least 150 square meters, 
street frontage of at least 20m, and near arterial roads.
```

**Extracted Constraints:**
- Geospatial/Location: In Business Bay district
- Geospatial/Zoning: Commercial properties only
- Operational/Size: Minimum 150 square meters
- Geospatial/Visibility: Minimum 20m street frontage
- Geospatial/Proximity: Near arterial roads

### Example 3: Restaurant with Economic and Demographic Constraints
```
Find locations for a premium restaurant in areas with average income above 25,000 AED/month, 
with rent below 200 AED/m², and at least 100 orders per day potential.
```

**Extracted Constraints:**
- Demographic/Income: Average income > 25,000 AED/month
- Economic/Cost: Rent < 200 AED/m²
- Market/Demand: Minimum 100 orders per day potential

## Advantages of Constraint-Based Approach

### 1. Clear Criteria
- Explicit constraints provide clear criteria for site selection
- Results are easily verifiable against constraints
- Reduces ambiguity in the selection process

### 2. Transparent Decision-Making
- Each constraint can be traced to specific data sources
- Decision logic is explicit and explainable
- Users understand why locations are included or excluded

### 3. Flexible Configuration
- Constraints can be added, removed, or modified easily
- Different constraint combinations can be tested
- System can adapt to changing requirements

### 4. Scalable Implementation
- Constraint checking can be parallelized
- New constraint types can be added without changing the core architecture
- Performance optimizations can be applied to specific constraint types

## Future Enhancements

### 1. Constraint Weighting
- Allow users to specify importance of different constraints
- Implement weighted constraint satisfaction scoring
- Support "soft" constraints vs. "hard" constraints

### 2. Constraint Relaxation
- Automatically relax constraints if no locations satisfy all constraints
- Suggest which constraints to relax for better results
- Provide alternative solutions with different constraint trade-offs

### 3. Constraint Inference
- Infer implicit constraints from user queries
- Learn common constraint patterns from usage
- Suggest additional relevant constraints
