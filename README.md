# Urban Fusion

## Introduction

Urban Fusion is a multi-agent AI framework designed to enhance participatory urban decision-making by integrating diverse urban datasets. Modern cities generate vast data streams, including citizen engagement data (e.g., 311 service requests, social media) and geospatial information (e.g., GIS maps, satellite imagery). However, traditional urban analytics often isolate these data modalities, limiting the ability to develop holistic, data-driven policies.

This research addresses the challenge of integrating multimodal urban data to support decision-makers in understanding complex urban dynamics. By fusing citizen engagement data with geospatial insights, Urban Fusion aims to provide actionable insights for urban planners and policymakers.

## Key Features

- **Multimodal Fusion**: Integrates textual and geospatial data to create context-aware models that assist in urban planning.
- **Agent Coordination**: Employs specialized agents for different data modalities, ensuring effective communication and synthesis of information.
- **Participatory Planning**: Facilitates interactive decision-making by summarizing community feedback and generating policy recommendations.

## Research Significance

Urban Fusion enhances urban analytics by:

- Identifying critical patterns and issues through integrated data analysis.
- Fostering transparent and inclusive decision-making processes.
- Developing robust AI-driven urban governance models that are responsive to community needs.

## Planned Execution

The project will utilize open-source datasets, including 311 service requests and GIS layers, to validate the framework. Key metrics will assess the effectiveness of the AI agents in providing actionable insights for urban challenges.

## Conclusion

Urban Fusion represents a significant step towards integrating citizen-reported data with geospatial context, enabling participatory, location-aware urban decision-making. By leveraging AI, this framework aims to transform urban governance and enhance community engagement in the planning process.
